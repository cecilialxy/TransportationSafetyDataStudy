# TransportationSafetyDataStudy
 
## What the project does?
The purpose of this project is using statistical methods to help understand the relationship of roadway safety risk factors (Roadway, Environment, Vehicle, Human) and the crashes (Occurence, Rate, Severity, Type).

## What information can we get from this project?
- By proving the two variables have association, we may:
  - Focus on studying the relevant features.
- By finding the direction (+ or -) of the association, we may:
  - Know how would the feature impact the transportation safety in general.
  - Risk perception.
- By measuring the strength of the association, we may:
  - Know to what extent the features would impact the transportation safety (quantify the impact).
  - Find areas that are more dangerous by just examining the data.
  - Pay more attention to the relevant features when doing transportation planning.

## Where to get start?
- Step 1: Check [Transportation-Study-Focused-CorrelationTest](./CorrelationTest/Transportation-Study-Focused-CorrelationTest.ipynb) chapter to find out:
  - What types of data are going to be studied.
  - What methodologies can be used to help understand the realtionship of the variables from mathematical aspect.
- Step 2: Check [CorrelationTestMethodology](./CorrelationTest/CorrelationTestMethodology.ipynb) chapter to understand the testing methodologies.
- Step 3: Check [CorrelationTestExample](./CorrelationTest/CorrelationTestExample.ipynb) chapter for examples of how to conduct the test and how to interpret the results.
